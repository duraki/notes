* [MacOS Reverse Engineering Companion App (idea)](/MacOS-RE-Companion-App)
* Identification of [cellular networks](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/CellGuard)
* Add this notes and my blog to [engineering-blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs) repo
* Use [m1ddc](https://github.com/waydabber/m1ddc) utility to control external displays
* SonicWall SMA100 Firmware 1day
* OPC Router DLL Hijacking, XML Attack via Licenses
* Make extension for Burp which can highlight any part of the Repeater/Intruder/ Proxy/Dec0der. A flow would is similar to: (1) selecting the appropriate text you wish to highlight; (2) rm click and select Highlight -> Favorited (color) from the Menu items. This came to me as an idea during the 36 hours grayhat sprint (day+night) which collected more then 40k requests. It would look similar to what Decoder currently looks like, albeit more colerful:

* Another extension which would be appreciated for PortSwiger's toolset is a Request/Response Header Tree implementation. User is able to "collapse" or "expand" Header keys in some views, or all of them, while editing or viewing message. It will show +/-~what you see on inspector, although more tidy. It would look similar to this:
