[Stheno](https://github.com/Ch0pin/stheno) is a subproject of [Medusa](/medusa) framework, specifically designed for intent monitoring in Android applications. Below is a quick guide on how to set up and use Stheno effectively.

Once you've loaded up [Medusa for Android](/using-medusa-android) in Terminal interactive shell, include the **Intent** module by adding the `intents/start_activity` module to the Medusa project:

```
medusa> add intents/start_activity
```

Run the Medusa **Socket Server** to facilitate communication as shown below:

```
medusa> startserver
```

Now launch Stheno and navigate to the "Intent Monitor" menu, then click on **Start** to begin monitoring intents.
