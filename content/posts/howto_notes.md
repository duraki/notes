* Use Markdown for everything, stand-alone deployment
* Use shortcodes, and develop custom ones
	* Note: shortcodes are commented-out
	* Note: correct syntax is `{{`<..>`}}` (no spaces between `{}` & `<>`)
* Clear and consistent, easy to implement new features

### Including Images

To include images, copy the image to `/content/posts/images/*`. Then when you want to include it, use either of:

```Â 
# => like this
![Image Caption](/posts/images/image-of-choice.png)

# => or
{{ < imgcap title="Image Caption" src="/posts/images/image-of-choice.png" > }}
```

The folder `images` in `content/posts` is created to index those files/images in the final build or deploy, and therefore removes the overhead of the Hugo processing. Some more [documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/) on Hugo website.

### Including Files

To include files of any type, ready to be downloaded, copy the file to `/content/posts/files/*`. Then include it in your post as instructed below:

```
[File to Download](/posts/files/some_file_to_download-example.pdf)
```

The folder `/content/posts/files` is used to serve and index those files in the final build/deploy.

### Markdown

**Styled Blocks**

```

Use `>` to quote in markdown block

```
>  For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, 
   plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give 
   you hope and a future. 

   - Jeremiah 29:11
```

**Wikipedia Insertion**

*You can either use named parameters:*

```
{{ < wikipedia tag="VIC_cipher" > }}
{{ < wikipedia tag="VIC_cipher" lang="fr" > }}
{{ < wikipedia tag="VIC_cipher" lang="fr" title="" > }}
