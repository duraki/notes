A **digital signal** is a discrete signal used in electrical circuits and devices. Digital signal is represented using binary values (`0`s & `1`s) indicating a LOW voltage (`0`) or a HIGH voltage (`1`). The signal is represented in square-wave frequencies when using a digital logic analyzer or oscilloscope. 

Electrical devices such are digital audio, video or computer modules are using these type of signals. These systems are called **digital systems**, which indicates that the information is represented by using digits. In digital signals, a digit can be binary (either `0` or `1`), and each of these two binary digits are called a `bit`. The meaning of each *bit* depends on the place where it is used, therefore, a *bit* can represent 'TRUE' or 'FALSE', or 'YES' & 'NO', and in [digital electronics](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics), these *bit* digits indicate a boolean representation of 'HIGH' and 'LOW', or may indicate a logic gate indicated by binary values of electrical volts.

This signal has two specific levels (`HIGH` & `LOW`), and it does not vary smoothly, meaning that data with digital **LOW** value (indicated by binary `0`) can be transmitted continuously, and likewise, the data with digital **HIGH** value (indicated by binary `1`) can also be transmitted continuously. The transmission of these LOW/HIGH data values is specified by the transmission rate (known as *bitrate*), which indicates the number of bits/data that is transferred within a specific frequency frame.

Digital signals are more reliable for long-distance transmission and storage. The digital signal only takes discrete values (ie. *LOW*/*HIGH* data in a binary form), as opposed to [Analog Signal](/electronics/analog-signal) which can vary in a continuous manner.

The conversion between the [`Analog<~>Digital Signals`](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Analog_and_Digital_Conversion) is a technique used to convert **Analog to Digital** (**ADC** - *Analog-to-Digital Converter*), and vice-versa, **Digital to Analog** (**DAC** - *Digital-to-Analog Converter*) signals.
