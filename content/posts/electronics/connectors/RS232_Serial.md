The RS232 is a serial interface used in particularly old times to send/receive data between two devices or electronic units. The RS232 is both an __RFC standard__ implementation, and also a serial interface - that is used to transfer data **bit-by-bit** at a time. Since the data is transferred bit-by-bit - RS232 requires only two wires. A single (1x) wire is needed to send the data over the RS232 serial interface, and another single (1x) wire which is used to receive the data. A common ground wire (GND) is required to enable current flow between two separated circuits (or devices). Therefore, RS232 in total requires only 3x wires to establish the communication between two devices.

The RS232 can be used to communicate between a variety of devices, for example, between the MCU and a GSM module, or, between a PC and a circuit - practically, the usability of this interface is wide.
