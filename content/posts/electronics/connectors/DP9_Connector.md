**DP-9 Connector Breakout Board**

This breakout board for DP-9 connector can help out if someone is working with electronic device that uses DP-9 port, especially if there are other [PCB](/electronics/pcb) pinouts next to it, therefore avoiding overvoltage or unintended short on the other pinouts via power leads (`V`-in/`V`out).

Simply take a prefboard (a [General Purpose PCB](/electronics/pcb)) and attach/solder a DIP header on it, with wires comming out on the DB-9 connector.
