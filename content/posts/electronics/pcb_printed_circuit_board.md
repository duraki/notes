Almost all electronic devices are made and composed of several [electrical components](/electronics/components), such is [Transistors](), [Diodes](), [Capacitors](), [Resistors](), [Switches](), [Buttons](), [Connectors]() and other. All these components are connected according to a circuit schematics. A **Printed Circuit Board** (PCB) helps holding all these components of the device in a single place, as a complete unit. At the same time, the PCBs provide required electrical connection between pins or terminals of the components.

### Types of PCB

**Manufactured PCBs**

**General Purpose PCBs**

General purpose PCBs, as their name suggests, is the generalised form of a PCB. These PCBs are used by hobbiest to freely make and assemble any kind of circuit as they wish. This makes it useful for small scale production of electronic devices, and prototyping new ideas before mass production or final manufacturing.

**Breadboards**

Breadboards, although not PCB *per-se*, is a very important circuit board used during the designing, building, and testing new circuits or during prototyping. They do not require soldering of the components, unlike the *General Purpose* & *Manufactured* PCBs, and due to this they are sometimes called **solderless breadboard**. Using breadboards allow hobbiest to make or design circuits without soldering, which is especially useful for beginners who don't know how to solder or haven't mastered the art of soldering.

### Removing glue from PCB

It is common to observe glued down [electrical components](/electronics/components), especially when dealing with [manufactured PCBs](#types-of-pcb), and there are different types of glues used. The **glue is commonly used to hold down components tightly** on the PCBs, therefore providing less vibrance and shock that may affect the components (in electronics, use of glue is sometimes called *mechanical stabilizer*).

The types of glue used depends on the hardware and the printed circuit board, as well as the type of device it is used on. Different glue types requires different approach when removing them, for example:

* **Hot Snot**/**Hot Melt Adhesive** ([example](https://i.imgur.com/kTjXiZ5.png)) - Commonly used, generally *whiteish/clear*, but can be colored as well, is removable using IPA (*Ispropyl Alcohol*) or use heating (hot air) to melt it down
* **Rubber/Polyurethane Adhesive** ([example](https://i.imgur.com/iGk6Bts.jpeg)) - Might be removed using accetone (acting as a solvent), Naptha (Zippo fluid), or freeze it with a freezer spray, then it becomes brittle and breaks off easily
* **Rubber/Sillicone Adhesive** ([example](https://i.imgur.com/RMkPkKY.jpeg)) - Reasonable approach for RTV sillicone is mechanical removal (scalpel), but freezing might help; using IPA may help during the removal process
* **Hardened-like Adhesives** ([example](https://i.imgur.com/awdvVJE.png)) - Albeit rarely seen on the PCBs, these can be *epoxy*, *polyester*, *acrylic* or similar adhesives; try removing it using heat (hot air) or similar
