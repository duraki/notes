title: "Coded Ground Signals"
---

Coded Ground Signals produce a set of High/Low requests, the combination (pattern) which is interpreted by the Control Module, to perform a specific function. Coded Ground Signals are generated through a switch, or a series of switches, signaling the control module requests for operation.

Below is an example of **Wiper Switch Schematic**, presenting a switch-based logic, depending on the pattern (Pin Status), executing different function depending on the Pin values.
