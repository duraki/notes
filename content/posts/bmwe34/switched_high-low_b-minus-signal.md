title: Switched B- (Low) Signals
---

Akin to [B+ Signal](/switched-b-high-signals), this Ground Signal produces an **ON/OFF** type input to the Control Module. The voltage level will indicate a specific operating condition.

The only **diference between a switched B- and switched B+ is the voltage**, in which the signals are switched.

This type of signal can be seen in BMW's Pinout diagrams, symboled by the **B-**.

Below is an example circuit that uses **B-** Digital Type Signal:

## Typical Application of Switched B+

* Door Position Switch
* Window Switches
* Sunroof Switch
