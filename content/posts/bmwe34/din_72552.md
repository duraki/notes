title: "DIN"
---

There is a terminal designation for almost every connection of a consumer or switch in the vehicle in order to facilitate the connection. The designation of the individual connections is defined in Germany, according to DIN 72552. The table below shows an excerpt of the most important connections from this DIN.

**DIN 72552** is a DIN (Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung) standard for labeling the electric terminals in automotive wiring. Visit this [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_72552) to learn more about this standard. 

*The column "Contact" is refering to a clamp of the connection (consumer), or a switch.*
