This note contains information on how to properly disassemble the BMW E34/E32 Instrument Cluster. You may also check a full disassembly video posted on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3MjNCDxD48). There is also full disassembly instructions in a lot of details on Russian's [Drive.ru - Disassembling the 'Low' E34 Instrument Cluster](https://www.drive2.ru/l/600386951031295206/).

### 1. Remove the Steering Wheel & Eject the Instrument Cluster

Make sure to lock the Steering Wheel fist by turning off the vehicle, removing the key from ignition, and turning the wheel left or right.

{{< details "Steering Wheel w/ Airbag" >}}
It's recommended to disconnect the negative battery cable in the vehicle first as shown in [this image](https://i.imgur.com/yeUljHH.jpeg) and wait a few minutes for the airbag to discharge all of its' electricity. Then, remove the 2 philips screws that hold the steering column cover on the bottom.

Once bottom panel is removed from the steering column, you will see an orange connector inside. That's the airbag connector. Squeeze the clip ends and separate the connector. Remove the end that goes to the steering wheel from the side its fastened to.

Using a T27 Torx Socket, remove the 2 screws on the back of the steering wheel that hold the airbag in place.

Next, you need to carefully lift the airbag assembly off the steering wheel, and disconnect the plug on the back. It comes straight out and is easily removed. Then set the airbag aside in a place where it won't get damaged.

Use the 22mm self-locking wrench nut that holds the steering wheel on. Once that nut is removed, mark the steering shaft and the wheel with a marker. A line across both so you can put the wheel back on in the same place. Next, put the key in the ignition and turn to the 1st position (ie. _Contact_). The steering wheel will then lift off:

Once the steering wheel is removed, unscrew the 2 philips screws that are located at the top of the Instrument Cluster, and carefully pull the cluster out far enough to remove the wiring connectors on the back. The connectors on the back of the Instrument Cluster has a quick release levers that are used to disconnect vehicle wiring with the cluster itself.

Use towel over the steering wheel hub as to not scratch the instrument cluster glass when pulling it out.

### 2. Place the Insturment Cluster on a Towel

### 3. Identitify all Backside Connectors

This will allow you later to work with different [Cluster version's](/instrument-clusters), or maybe enagage in [Cluster Conversion](/cluster-conversion).

### 4. Separate front-half from back-half

Unscrew the two plastic hinges at the bottom that holds the cluster in one piece.

### 5. Open the cluster now using screwdrive or similar

### 6. Detach the top hinges to separate two sides fully

You will have two sides now, a front panel containing the glass enclosure, and the gauges, as well as back panel which contains instrument cluster PCB and plug connectors.

### 7. Further separate Glass enclosure & Gauge Panel

Remove the 6 screws holding the two cluster panes together. The front will be stuck to the back along the metal brace. Carefully push the brace forward at tabs with a flat head screwdriver. These two panes will separate.

The remaining part which sits in the middle will have the gauges, display (if the cluster is **HIGH** version).

### 8. Separate Gauges from the Gauge Panel

All gauges for the Fuel Level, KM/H, RPM, and Engine Temperature can be removed by lifting the gauge from the Gauge Panel. They are not fixed to anything and can be removed easily.

### 9. Disassemble the PCB from Plastic Back Panel

Remove the the 6 screws holding the PCB connectors to the Back Panel plastic lid (indicated with **YELLOW** in the image below). The back panel plug connector frames on the back of the lid are *clicked* into the connectors on the PCB. To remove these connector housing from the back panel; you have to *push in* the clips of the connector from the PCB side. There are 4 clips per each plug connector housing (indicated with **RED** in the image below). These clips can't be seen, but they can be used to remove the back panel connectors from the actual PCB (white) housing.

{{< details "Note on Connector Housing" >}}
On newer clusters, the housing is usually on both: the *back panel*, and also on the *PCB* as shown in image below:

To remove housing from the PCB on these instrument cluster models, you need to insert screwdriver in the PCB connector space and unhinge it, like so:

Here is a good tutorial how to [remove these connectors and housing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln26cPpp7HU).

You now should have a detached PCB ready for service/modding.
