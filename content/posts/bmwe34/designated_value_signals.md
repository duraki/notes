title: "Designated Value Signals"
---

Designated Values are produced through fixed resistance positions of a multi-position switch.

As the switch is operated, the voltage drop across the resistor(s) of each switch position causes the voltage level of the input signal to change to a predetermined (designated, fixed, constant) voltage value.

These predetermined (designated) voltage signals the Control Module to perform specific functions.

Below is an example diagram showing a Control Module unit with internal resistor, using **Input Signal** (predetermined voltage values). In a Switch Function, a constant resistor values are shown, which causes the operation flow to execute depending on the resistance value.
