*Quick-jump* to [AC and DC Signals](/ac-and-dc-signals)

## Purpose of Electronic Signals

- Electronic Signals move information like cars move passenger down the highway
- Signals allow devices (e.g. sensors, or switches) to communicate with Control Modules
  - Such communication can be completed via simple Relays
  - Other times, the communication requires a complicated processor
- Signals and the modules perform or request (through more signaling) other functions to be carried out

**Example of Signals**
- A Signal can inform the Climate Control the outside air temperature.
- A Signal can inform the brake lights the right time to illuminate.
- A Signal can inform the DME to enable ABS due to rain.

The *use of electronic signals* goes far beyond the basic application of electron flow to some components. Electronic signals enables *(or allow)* complex information to be passed from one component to another.

The data (input or output) is exchanged through various forms such is **changing voltages**, **resistance**, **current** or **frequency modulation**.

[Electronic Signals](/ac-and-dc-signals) are divided into two (2) main groups. There is [AC Type Signals](/ac-voltage-signals) and [DC Type Signals](/dc-voltage-signals).
