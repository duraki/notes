title: "E34 Repair & Restoration"
---

Please, check [Upgradables](/upgrade-wishlist) as well. These show my to-do, and wishlist that I planned for my E34. 

### Fixing and repairing Cigarette Lighter

If the cigarette lighter no longer works, simply bend the two lugs at the rear-end of the socket **sligthly inwards**, with a **plastic rod** and it will work again.

### Fixing Cluster and Interior Lights

**Requirement**

* Two type of bulbs (*both ending with orange wires*)
  - T1 14V/40mA or 14V/60mA (3x6mm)
  - T1 1/4 14V/80mA ~ equates to 1.2W

Use **T1 14/40mA** (or 14/60mA) for: *lumbar switch*, *sport seat switch*, *old seat heating switch*, *rear blind switch*, *memory switch* etc.

Use **T1 1/4 80mA** for: *sunroof switch*, *automatic program switch*, *rear window switch*, *light switch*, *NSW switch* etc.

Use [E34Wiki Table List](https://www.e34wiki.de/index.php/Leuchtmittel) for all Bulbs that might need replacing. 

### Opening doors with a dead battery

Use the emergency unlock procedure; work every time with a dead battery. 

* Turn passenger lock as to unlock the car, 
* Keep it there, 
* Pull the handle and turn key some more,
* Release the handle and turn more again,
* This will unlock your door.
