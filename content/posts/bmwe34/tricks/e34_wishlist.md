### Mini Wishlist

- [BMW Bentley Service Manual Hardcopy for E34](https://racegerman.com/collections/e34-all-products/products/bmw-bentley-service-manuals?variant=41851859009690), and also [BMW 5 & 6 Series - E12, E24, E28, E34 Restoration Tips & Techniques](https://www.pelicanparts.com/More_Info/BK211056.htm?pn=BK-211056&SVSVSI=219&DID=45742). The [Guide to European Automotive Electrical Systems](https://www.pelicanparts.com/More_Info/BKBHME.htm?pn=BK-BHME&SVSVSI=219&DID=31321) published by Bentley seems like a good book as well.

### Upgrade: Performance

- [PRO 'ShortBoy' Short Shifter for BMW E34 w/ Direct Fit Kit](https://coolerworx.com/collections/bmw/products/pro-short-boy-short-shifter-for-bmw-e30-e34-e36-e46-e8x-e9x-and-more) (~1.345 BAM), or
  - The diffence between **PRO** and **PRO (ShortBoy)** is that the PRO ShortBoy version has shorter shift handle (~ 330mm), instead of original longer handle (~ 370mm).
- [REGULAR Short Shifter for BMW E34 w/ Direct Fit Kit](https://coolerworx.com/products/regular-short-shifter-for-bmw-e30-e34-e36-e46-e8x-e9x-and-more) (~1.110 BAM).
  - The difference between **PRO** and **REGULAR** is that the PRO has a so-called *Self-centering Spring*, which makes the shifter always stays centered, even in hard braking and cornering, providing consistent shifting feedback. Basically, no second-guessing, slam the gears without worry.
  - The [Direct Fit Kit](https://coolerworx.com/products/coolerworx-short-shifter-direct-fit-kit-bmw) for BMW E34 Chasis is included in above prices, but can be bought separately (~271 BAM)


### Upgrade: Wheels/Rims

- I'm a sucker for **M-System II "Throwing Start"** Wheels/Rims, sits well with E34
- A classic such is **Style 32** BBS Wheels/Rims, another favorite of mine is **Style 129** - preferably size of 18", as well as [BBS RC wheels 18"](https://hawknpoke.com/2015/02/greatness-within-bmw-m5-e34-bbs/) and [BBS RS 744/745 18x8/18x9](https://i.imgur.com/bw7TJ07.jpeg)

- **Katalysator Removal** +349,00 EUR - The removal of the catalytic converter
  and the associated electronic adjustment lead to less exhaust gas pressure and
  thus to a better flow of exhaust gases and more agile driving behavior.
- **Fuel Cut-off** +349,00 EUR - By deactivating the overrun fuel cut-off, the
  fuel supply to the combustion engine is no longer cut off. On the one hand,
  turbo engines can maintain their boost pressure and the popular boost popping
  occurs.
- **VMax Nullification** +699,00 EUR - Removes a software limited maximum speed,
  without performance increase.
