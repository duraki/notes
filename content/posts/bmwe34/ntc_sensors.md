**NTC** (*Negative Temperature Coefficient*) sensors is a type of [DC Analog Sensor](/dc-voltage-signals) which change resistance based on temperature.

When a **temperature goes up**, the **resistance goes down**. This decrease in resistance causes the voltage drop across the sensor to decrease. Therefore, the input signal voltage at the Control Module decreases.

Check [PTC Sensors](/ptc-sensors) as well as [NTC/PTC Sensor Troubleshooting](/ptc-sensors) for more details on this kind of Sensors.
