title: "AC and DC Signals"

This is part of BMW E34 Learning Resources, Topics related to Signals. See [Learning Resource index page](/bmw-ag-e34-learning-materials) and [Electronic Signals](/electronic-signals) for more details. 

There are two types of such signals in BMW factory/production process:

* [AC Type Signals](/ac-voltage-signals), induced by shifting of a magnetic field, 
* [DC Type Signals](/dc-voltage-signals), induced via multiple types of signals and sensors (Analog, Digital, Coded et al.).

It's important to note that two types of data/information transmission signals are known in electrical engineerings, and these are [Analog Signals](/electronics/analog-signal) & [Digital Signals](/electronics/digital-signal). To convert different type of signals, a ADC/DAC converters are used - [this PDF](https://www.analog.com//media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Basic-Linear-Design/Chapter6.pdf) hosted by `analog.com` greatly explores this topic in-depth.

Reference to external link [AC, DC and Electrical Signals](https://electronicsclub.info/acdc.htm) hosted by **Electronics Club**, describing aftermentioned signals in more details. The lab materials titled "`ADALM1000 Based Lab Activity (Electronics I and II)`" [freely available here](https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/alm1k/alm-labs-list), goes into detail on analog devices controls, conversion and communication in circuit engineering. The aftermentioned lab material is based on [`ADALM1000 Overview`](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/m1k) learning module which I highly recommend referencing to first, and then moving to lab activities later on.
