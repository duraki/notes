This is part of BMW E34 Learning Resources, Topics related to Signals. See [Learning Resource index page](/bmw-ag-e34-learning-materials) and [Electronic Signals](/electronic-signals) for more details. 

There are two types of such signals in BMW factory/production process:

* [AC Type Signals](/ac-voltage-signals), induced by shifting of a magnetic field, 
* [DC Type Signals](/dc-voltage-signals), induced via multiple types of signals and sensors (Analog, Digital, Coded et al.).
