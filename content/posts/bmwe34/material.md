title: "BMW E34 Learning Material and Resources"
---

This is Bavarian (*E34 5-series focused*) learning materials and resources, mostly related to ECUs, DMEs, Tuning, EE, Wirings et al. The documentation is written and compiled with different models and versions in mind, but keeping the methodologies of the BMW Technical Documentation collected and researched through the years. Nevertheless, a lot of topics and information presented here are #ReverseEngineered from the very low or no available resources, for years in the past.

{{< details "Quick: Electronic Signals" >}}
Objectives of the [Electronic Signals](/electronic-signals) is to explain inductive sensors, and type of signals one may stumble upon during the reversing and hacking of BMW E34s and possibly other series as well. Upon completion, you should understand the difference between analog and digital signals, know the difference between NTC and PTC sensors, recognizing different signals on the oscilloscope etc. Besides, many EE stuff can be learn from reading the resources published.

{{< details "Bus Networks" >}}
**BMW** utiliese Bus Networks on their vehicle. Starting from E38, BMW marked the first large scale usage of bus network on BMW vehicles. For the first time, bus networks are used to reduce overall wiring requirements. More about Bus Systems can be found in the [Power Supply and Bus Systems (pdf) (ext)](https://ia801005.us.archive.org/11/items/BMWTechnicalTrainingDocuments/ST052%20Body%20Electronics%20II/02a_Power%20Supply%20and%20Bus%20Systems.pdf).
