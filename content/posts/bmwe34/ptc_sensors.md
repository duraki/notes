title: "PTC Sensors"

**PTC** (*Positive Temperature Coefficient*) sensors is a type of [DC Analog Sensor](/dc-voltage-signals) which change resistance based on temperature. 

In a PTC sensor, as the **temperature goes up**, the **resistance also goes up**. The increase in resistance causes the voltage drop across the sensor to increase, and the input signal voltage at the Control Module increases.

When troubleshooting a faulty input display, the input signal must be verified as **VALID** before the Control Module is replaced.

When checking a PTC/NTC Sensor, look for these voltages and problems:

* **If it's 0V**, no supply voltage or shorted to ground
* **If it's 2V**, sensor is indicating a warm condition for system being measured
* **If it's 4V**, sensor is indicating a cold condition for system being measured
* **If it's 5V**, sensor or wiring harness is open

**Remember:** A PTC type sensor will indicate opposite results on intermediate readings (i.e. 4V, sensor is indicating warm condition).
