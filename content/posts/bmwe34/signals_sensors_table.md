### Bench Test Tricks and Tips

* You can easily send required signal for `B/type` Switches, just by checking the Signal Type of the specific Pin.
* For example:
	- Pin 3, is a "Fuel Level Warning Light" on X13060. It has signal type **B-**.
	- You can ground this pin and the light will turn on, indicating the Fuel Warning.

### Terminal Designations

There is a terminal designation for almost every connection of a consumer or switch in the vehicle in order to facilitate the connection. The designation of the individual connections is defined in Germany according to DIN 72552. 

Refer to [DIN 72552](/din) page for more details.
