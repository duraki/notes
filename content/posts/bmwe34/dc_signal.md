## Types of DC Voltage Signals 

Five Types of DC Voltage Signals are used:

* [Analog Signals](#dc-analog-signals)
* [Digital Signals](#dc-digital-signals)
* [Designated Value Signals](#dc-designated-value-signals)
* [Coded Ground Signals](#coded-ground-signals)
* [Transistor Signals](#transistor-signals)

**DC Voltage Signals are based on either 5 Volts or 12 Volts.**

### DC Analog Signals

Analog signals transmit information through an electrical circuit by regulating or changing the **current** or **voltage**. 

Three (3) sources of analog signals are:

* [NTC Sensors](/ntc-sensors) - Negative Temperature Coefficient
* [PTC Sensors](/ptc-sensors) - Positive Temperature Coefficient
* [Potentiometers](/potentiometers)

Read more about [NTC/PTC Troubleshooting](/ptc-sensors) for potential problems in wiring and schema understanding.

### DC Digital Signals

Digital Signals transfer information through electrical circuit, by switching the current **ON** (1) or **OFF** (0).

Unlike Analog Signals which uses voltage, a digital signal has only two possible states, *control voltage* (1) or *zero voltage* (0).

Two (2) types of Digital Signals:

* [Switched (High) Signals - **B+**](/switched-b-high-signals)
* [Switched (Low) Signals - **B-**](/switched-b-low-signals)
* [Modulated **Square Wave** Signals](/modulated-square-wave-signals)
