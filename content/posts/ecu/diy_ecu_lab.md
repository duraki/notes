This note describe how to create a low-cost training [ECU](/ecu-foundation) (Electornic Control Unit) that can be attacked, without damagning a real car.

Take a look at Quarkslab's blogpost "[Development of a training ECU](https://blog.quarkslab.com/development-of-a-training-ecu.html)" which goes into details on how to build a training ECU based on Teensy3.2 MCU and some sensors. There is expanded tutorial on building a [complete vehicle system in a transportable box](https://blog.quarkslab.com/how-i-built-a-car-in-a-box.html) also from Quarkslab.

Albeit it's from 2018, there is [PASTA: Portable Automotive Security Testbed](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-18/briefings/schedule/#pasta-portable-automotive-security-testbed-with-adaptability-13204), a Blackhat Conf' breefing talk from Toyota Center Team in which they explain how they created portable automotive testbed for vehicle research and training.
