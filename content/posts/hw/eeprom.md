title: "EEPROM"
---

EEPROM is read-only non-volatile memory whose contents can be erased and reprogrammed using a pulsed voltage often time used in embedded systems and it may hold firmware data and bootloader, among other.

SOIC8, it’s programming chip which allows embedded software developers to test EEPROM chips not just you can write changes with it but also read existing data from there or you can say dump the firmware easily.

Now next step is to identify model number of our EEPROM chip and it’s orientation on PCB, challenge here is small size. Due to their very small size it is often impossible to see the text written on the chip with naked eyes. What you can do is use soldering microscope or if you don’t have one you can use camera of your smart phone along with flash light hold at 45 degree angle for best viewing experience since direct flash light on chip will make hard to see the text.
