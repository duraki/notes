## Syncthing

It's possible to install `Syncthing` on multiple Desktop machines running any major Operating System (MacOS, WindowsNT, or GNU/Linux). Syncthing is a free and [open source](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) peer-to-peer file synchronization application available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, Solaris, Darwin, and BSD. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet.

* [Syncthing - Official Website](https://syncthing.net/)

Once installed, opening Syncthing will start a HTTP daemon running on `http://127.0.0.1:8384/`. Clicking on the "+ Add Remote Device" will open a new `Add Device`Â pop-up, in which the user must enter Device ID, corresponding to the ID of the running Syncthing instance.

To apply continuous computer syncing, you need to add corresponding folders which are set to be in sync. Use the "+ Add Folder" button to add a new synced folder between multiple computers.
