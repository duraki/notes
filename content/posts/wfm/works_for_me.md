  #     Note that, if you want hyperlink a specific software in SOFTWARE_LIST
  #     you can do so using the following Markdown syntax:
  #           [IINA](//example.com)
  #     This will make sure the user is redirected to correct page, and that the
  #     potential semicolon (`:`) in URL prefixed "http(s)://" don't trigger the
