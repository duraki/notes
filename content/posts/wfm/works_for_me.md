  # Declaring <SW_FULL> category
  # Describe:
  #     This is a CATEGORY definition for <SW_FULL>. Used to create a separator
  #     between categories, and as a place to display all softwares installed and
  #     used, per each category of the software.
  #
  #     The 'collapsible' flag declares whether the given key array should be
  #     rendered in '<details>' HTML tag which provides a collapsable UI. If the
  #     collapsible is set to 'true', all keys in 'description' will be collapsed
  #     and user will need to click on the 'name' to expand the collapsable
  #     section.
  #
  #     The 'description' array is used to describe both the CATEGORY and the
  #     SOFTWARE_LIST in a format '<CATEGORY>:<SOFTWARE_LIST>'. By using this
  #     format, the `themes/.../partials/wfm/tool_wfm.html` will now use the
  #     ":" (semicolon) delimiter to split CATEGORY and the SOFTWARE_LIST, and
  #     render them beautifuly.
  #
  #     Note that, if you want hyperlink a specific software in SOFTWARE_LIST
  #     you can do so using the following Markdown syntax:
  #           [IINA](//example.com)
  #     This will make sure the user is redirected to correct page, and that the
  #     potential semicolon (`:`) in URL prefixed "http(s)://" don't trigger the
  #     splitting parse errors.
