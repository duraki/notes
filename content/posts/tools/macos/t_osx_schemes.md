Custom URL schemes provide a way to reference resources inside your app. You can connect to content deep inside your app with universal links. Users open your app in a specified context, allowing them to accomplish their goals efficiently.

Refer to [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content) to learn how apps. communicate and handle URI schemes.
