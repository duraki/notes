### Privacy

* [one.one.one.one](https://one.one.one.one/dns/) - Probably the [fastest DNS](http://dnsperf.com/dns-resolver/1-1-1-1) backbone for free, [provided by CloudFlare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.1.1.1)
  * Set your HostOS DNS to resolve via `1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1` instead of using default ISP modem DNS
  * The `1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1` provides encrypted DNS for free and is usually faster than ISP provided ones
  * You can install [WARP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/warp-for-desktop) which is essentially a VPN tunnel, alongside with encrypted DNS for all network traffic between any device, and the [Cloudflare servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) *nearest to you*
  * For enterprise-grade users, there is a [WARP+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.1.1.1#WARP+_and_WARP+_Unlimited) which in addition offers faster speeds/bw, is privacy-oriented and allows for other VPN confs
  * In essence, the CF's *`1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1` is a **DNS resolver**, and `WARP` **is a VPN**.*
  * **Note:** You may add IPv6 DNS resolvers; use `2606:4700:4700::1111` and `2606:4700:4700::1001` alongside the `1.1.1.1` DNS
  * [macOS Setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/macos/), [iOS Setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/ios/), [Android Setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/android/) or directly on [Router](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/router/)
