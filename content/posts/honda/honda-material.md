This is a Japan's Honda Accord TypeS (`MF:[EU] MY:[2004]`) (*Honda Accord focused*) learning materials and resources, mostly related to ECUs, DMEs, Tuning, EE, Wirings et al. Besides my daily-driven [BMW E34 Series 5 '94](/bmw-ag-e34-learning-materials) beauty with *M50B20TU* 2.0L [ECU](/ecu-foundations) [tuned](/bmw/modding/ecu) *inline straight-6* gasoline engine, I also own and I'm daily modding a beautiful black Honda Accord TypeS '04, with it's undestructable *K24A3 inline 4-cylinder* gasoline engine, offering ~200PS straight from the manufacturer.

The documentation is written and compiled based on *JDM/Int/EU*-based Honda Accord, with models manufactured between `2004-2008`. A lot of topics and information presented here are part of my #AutomotiveCybsec *~notes*, alongside the detailed & technical hardware-oriented #ReverseEngineering generalities (with additional spark of *firmware hacking and research*). As always, if you stumbled upon this on the internet, you can always [thank me later â†’](https://linkedin.com/in/duraki/) or ask any further questions.

When I cross-referenced a URL hosted online that is used during repair and diagnosis of the [BMW](/bmw/misc/tutorials), I also found another helpful repair manual to quickly find instructions for [Honda Accord MY. 04](https://charm.li/Honda/2004/Accord%20L4-2.4L/) for `L4-2.4L (DOHC)` engine (K24) as well.

Reference to [Vehicle Identification Number](https://charm.li/Honda/2004/Accord%20L4-2.4L/Repair%20and%20Diagnosis/Application%20and%20ID/Vehicle%20Identification%20Number/) (*VIN*) decoding guide, and [engine number decoding](https://charm.li/Honda/2004/Accord%20L4-2.4L/Repair%20and%20Diagnosis/Application%20and%20ID/Engine%20Number/) guide to identify exact Honda Accord model. The location of the VIN and EN are shown [on this URL](https://charm.li/Honda/2004/Accord%20L4-2.4L/Repair%20and%20Diagnosis/Application%20and%20ID/Identification%20Number%20Locations/).

The [ECM/PCM](https://charm.li/Honda/2004/Accord%20L4-2.4L/Repair%20and%20Diagnosis/Diagrams/Harness/ECM%2FPCM%20Wire%20Harness/) wire harness is different based on the Accord model and the country its been manufactured/produced for. It's recommended to use `5W-20` engine oil labeled *for gasoline engines* only!
