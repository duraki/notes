# ~ notes

A `~ notes` is a dedicated page of my knowledgebase and oneliners for multiple purposes, as well as explaining my toolset and directory. You can observe or change those notes following Hugo notation. It is implemented due to speed and support of notes themeing option. The notes idea are taken from Andy's note-taking samples on his site.
